- **Comfort**: Ensure devices are comfortable and non-intrusive for patients wearing them continuously.

## Installation Guidelines
- **Coverage**: Install sensors and alarms in all patient areas, including private rooms, wards, and ICUs.
- **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure connectivity and reliability across different hospital sections.

## Maintenance and Support
- **Regular Inspections**: Perform regular maintenance checks to ensure the functionality of all components.
- **Battery Checks**: Regularly check and replace batteries in portable and wearable devices.
