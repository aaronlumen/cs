# Data Communication Devices

## General Requirements
Data communication devices are essential for the transmission of data within healthcare facilities. These devices must meet specific standards to ensure reliable and secure communication.

## Network Switches
- **Types**: Use managed switches that support VLANs, QoS, and PoE.
- **Performance**: Ensure switches provide gigabit or higher data transfer rates.
- **Redundancy**: Implement redundancy features such as stacking and dual power supplies.

## Routers
- **Performance**: Use routers that support high data throughput and advanced routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP).
- **Security**: Ensure routers have robust security features, including firewall capabilities and VPN support.
- **Management**: Use routers with centralized management capabilities for configuration and monitoring.

## Firewalls
- **Types**: Use next-generation firewalls (NGFW) that provide advanced threat protection.
- **Features**: Ensure firewalls support deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, and application control.
- **Scalability**: Use scalable firewall solutions to accommodate network growth.

## Wireless Access Points
- **Standards**: Use WAPs that support the latest Wi-Fi standards (e.g., Wi-Fi 6).
- **Security**: Implement WPA3 encryption and robust authentication methods.
- **Management**: Use centralized wireless controllers for easy management and configuration.

## Endpoints
- **Types**: Include desktops, laptops, tablets, and medical devices.
- **Security**: Ensure all endpoints have up-to-date antivirus software and encryption.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly update and patch all endpoints to maintain security and performance.
