# Security Systems

## General Requirements
Security systems are essential for protecting healthcare facilities, staff, and patients. These systems must provide comprehensive coverage, reliable performance, and integration with other hospital systems.

## Access Control
- **Types**: Use electronic access control systems with card readers, biometric scanners, or keypads.
- **Zones**: Define access zones to restrict entry to sensitive areas such as data centers, pharmacies, and operating rooms.
- **Logging**: Ensure access control systems log all entry and exit events for auditing purposes.

## Surveillance Systems
- **Cameras**: Use high-definition IP cameras with features such as night vision and motion detection.
- **Coverage**: Provide comprehensive coverage of entrances, exits, hallways, and other critical areas.
- **Storage**: Implement secure storage solutions for video recordings with sufficient retention periods.

## Intrusion Detection
- **Sensors**: Use motion sensors, door/window contacts, and glass break detectors.
- **Integration**: Integrate intrusion detection systems with access control and surveillance systems for comprehensive security.
- **Alerting**: Implement real-time alerting and notification for security breaches.

## Emergency Communication
- **Systems**: Use intercom systems, public address systems, and mass notification systems.
- **Coverage**: Ensure coverage in all areas, including parking lots, stairwells, and common areas.
- **Testing**: Regularly test emergency communication systems to ensure functionality.

## Maintenance and Updates
- **Regular Inspections**: Conduct regular inspections and maintenance of all security systems.
- **Updates**: Keep all software and firmware up-to-date to ensure security and performance.
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of all security systems, configurations, and changes.
