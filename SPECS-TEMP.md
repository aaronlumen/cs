Provide independent support system for each low voltage cabling system.  
Cable Installation  
All communications cabling that has become abandoned as part of new renovation projects, previous  renovation projects, or temporary communication cables used during the construction process shall be  completely removed. Abandoned communication cables that may have future use can remain in place if  labeled clear at both end and at regular intervals of the cable run. (Refer to NEC Article 800.52 for more  information regarding the removal of abandoned communication cables).  
All cables shall be bundled using plenum rated ties, loosely tied so as not to deform cable, 5 [ft.] -0 [in.] on center  (at mid-span).

Avoid placing copper cables near sources of extreme heat (i.e., boilers, radiators, heat coils).  
Maintain cable twists for all UTP cables. For terminations cable sheathing shall be stripping back no more than ½”  back from termination point for all Category 6 cables.  
All cables shall be supported by cable tray, J-hooks, or cable runway. When cables leave trays or runways, cables  shall be supported by drop-outs or cable support hardware manufactured specifically for the purpose of supporting  cables. J-hooks shall be installed a minimum of every 5 feet and cabling shall maintain minimal deflection and  strain (less than 12” deflection). Cables shall not be supported by ceiling grid wires.  
Cables shall not run above iron joists.  
All cables shall be separated and bundled into like groups by cable sheathing colors.  
Service loops shall be provided at both ends of installed Category 6 cabling.

Pathways  
Not For Distribution

Install pathways with the following minimum clearances:  
48 [in.] (1220 mm) from motors, generators, frequency converters, transformers, x-ray equipment, and  uninterruptible power systems.  
12 [in.] (300 mm) from power conduits and cables and panelboards.  
5 [in.] (125 mm) from fluorescent and high frequency lighting fixtures.  
6 [in.] (150 mm) from flues, hot water pipes, and steam pipes.  
Arrange conduit to provide no more than the equivalent of two 90 degree bend(s) between pull points.  Conduit Bends: Inside radius not less than 10x conduit internal diameter.  
Arrange conduit to provide no more than 100 [ft.] (30 m) between pull points.  
Do not use conduit bodies.  
Equipment Outlets  
Coordinate locations of outlet boxes provided under Section 260533.16 as required for installation of  telecommunications outlets provided under this section.  
Mounting Heights: Unless otherwise indicated, as follows:  
Orient outlet boxes for vertical installation of wiring devices unless otherwise indicated.  
Provide minimum of 24 inches (600 mm) horizontal separation between flush mounted outlet boxes installed on  opposite sides of fire rated walls.  
Unless otherwise indicated, provide separate outlet boxes for line voltage and low voltage devices.  
Locate outlet boxes so that wall plate does not span different building finishes.  
Locate outlet boxes so that wall plate does not cross masonry joints.  
Cable  
Do not bend cable at radius less than manufacturer's recommended bend radius; for unshielded twisted pair use  bend radius of not less than 4 times cable diameter.  
Do not over-cinch or crush cables.  
Do not exceed manufacturer's recommended cable pull tension.  
Not For Distribution
When installing in conduit, use only lubricants approved by cable manufacturer and do not chafe or damage outer  jacket.  
Service Loops (Slack or Excess Length),, Provide the following minimum extra length of cable, looped neatly: 10  [ft.] outside of IDF {TDR], 3 [ft.] at the Equipment Outlet and 20 [ft.] in close proximity of Wireless Access Point.  
Copper Cabling  
Category 5e and Above: Maintain cable geometry; do not untwist more than 1/2 inch (12 mm) from point of  termination.  
For 4-pair cables in conduit, do not exceed 25 pounds (110 N) pull tension.  
Use T568B wiring configuration.  
Identification  
Use wire and cable markers to identify cables at each end.  
Use manufacturer-furnished label inserts, identification labels, or engraved wallplate to identify each jack at  communications outlets with unique identifier.  
Use identification nameplate to identify cross-connection equipment, equipment racks, and cabinets.  Inspect cable jackets for certification markings.  
Inspect cable terminations for color coded labels of proper type.  
Inspect outlet plates and patch panels for complete labels.  
Inspect patch cords for complete labels.
