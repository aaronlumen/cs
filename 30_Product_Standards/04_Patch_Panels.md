# Patch Panels

## General Requirements
Patch panels are used to terminate and manage network cables in telecommunications rooms. They must be organized, labeled, and accessible to ensure efficient network management.

## Types of Patch Panels
### Copper Patch Panels
- **Cat 6A Patch Panels**: Use for terminating Cat 6A cables.
- **Ports**: Typically available in 24-port and 48-port configurations.
- **Shielding**: Use shielded patch panels to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI).

### Fiber Optic Patch Panels
- **Types**: Use for terminating single-mode and multimode fiber optic cables.
- **Ports**: Available in various port configurations, such as LC, SC, and MPO connectors.
- **Management**: Include splicing trays and cable management features.

## Installation Guidelines
- **Mounting**: Mount patch panels in standard 19-inch racks or cabinets.
- **Labeling**: Clearly label each port on the patch panel for easy identification.
- **Cable Management**: Use horizontal and vertical cable managers to organize and support cables.
- **Testing**: Perform continuity and performance testing after termination.

## Compliance and Standards
- **ANSI/TIA-568**: Ensure patch panels comply with the ANSI/TIA-568 standards for structured cabling.
- **ISO/IEC 11801**: Follow international standards for structured cabling.
- **UL Listing**: Use UL-listed patch panels for safety and reliability.
