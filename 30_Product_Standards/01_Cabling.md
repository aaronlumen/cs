# Cabling

## General Requirements
The cabling infrastructure in healthcare facilities must support current and future data and communication needs. It must be installed to high standards to ensure reliability, performance, and compliance with industry regulations.

## Types of Cabling
### Category 6A (Cat 6A) Cable
- **Usage**: Standard for data networks in healthcare facilities.
- **Performance**: Supports 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GBASE-T) up to 100 meters.
- **Shielding**: Use shielded twisted pair (STP) to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI).

### Fiber Optic Cable
- **Single-mode Fiber**: Used for long-distance and high-bandwidth applications, such as backbone cabling.
- **Multimode Fiber**: Used for shorter distances within buildings.
- **Installation**: Ensure proper bend radius and protection from physical damage.

### Coaxial Cable
- **Usage**: Used for video distribution and certain medical imaging systems.
- **Types**: Use RG-6 or RG-11 depending on the application requirements.

## Installation Guidelines
- **Pathways**: Use conduits, cable trays, and J-hooks to support and protect cabling.
- **Separation**: Maintain separation from power cables to prevent interference.
- **Labeling**: Clearly label all cables at both ends and at regular intervals along the length.
- **Testing**: Perform testing for continuity, length, attenuation, and return loss to ensure installation quality.

## Compliance and Standards
- **ANSI/TIA-568**: Ensure all cabling installations comply with the ANSI/TIA-568 standards.
- **ISO/IEC 11801**: Follow international standards for structured cabling.
- **NFPA 70**: Comply with the National Electrical Code (NEC) for all electrical installations.
