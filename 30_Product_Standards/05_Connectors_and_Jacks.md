# Connectors and Jacks

## General Requirements
Connectors and jacks are critical components in telecommunications systems, providing the interface between network cables and devices. They must be reliable, durable, and compliant with industry standards.

## Types of Connectors and Jacks
### Copper Connectors and Jacks
- **RJ45 Connectors**: Use for terminating Cat 6A cables.
- **Shielding**: Use shielded connectors to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI).
- **Tool-less Options**: Consider tool-less connectors for easier installation.

### Fiber Optic Connectors
- **Types**: Use LC, SC, ST, or MPO connectors based on application requirements.
- **Single-mode and Multimode**: Ensure compatibility with the type of fiber optic cable used.
- **Polish Types**: Use appropriate polish types (UPC, APC) for the application.

## Installation Guidelines
- **Termination**: Follow manufacturer guidelines for proper termination techniques.
- **Testing**: Perform insertion loss and return loss testing for fiber optic connectors.
- **Labeling**: Clearly label all connectors and jacks for easy identification.
- **Protection**: Use dust caps and protective covers to prevent contamination and damage.

## Compliance and Standards
- **ANSI/TIA-568**: Ensure connectors and jacks comply with the ANSI/TIA-568 standards.
- **ISO/IEC 11801**: Follow international standards for structured cabling.
- **UL Listing**: Use UL-listed connectors and jacks for safety and reliability.
