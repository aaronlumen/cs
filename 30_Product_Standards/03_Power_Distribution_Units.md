# Power Distribution Units (PDUs)

## General Requirements
Power Distribution Units (PDUs) distribute electrical power to networking equipment within racks. They must ensure reliable power delivery, monitoring, and management to maintain network uptime.

## Types of PDUs
### Basic PDUs
- **Usage**: Provide basic power distribution without advanced features.
- **Configuration**: Typically include multiple outlets for connecting equipment.
- **Mounting**: Available in horizontal and vertical mounting configurations.

### Metered PDUs
- **Usage**: Provide real-time monitoring of power consumption at the PDU level.
- **Features**: Include displays for local monitoring and may support remote monitoring via network interfaces.
- **Benefits**: Help manage power usage and capacity planning.

### Switched PDUs
- **Usage**: Allow remote switching on/off of individual outlets.
- **Features**: Enable remote power cycling of equipment and support load shedding.
- **Benefits**: Improve control and management of power distribution in the data center.

### Intelligent PDUs
- **Usage**: Combine metering and switching capabilities with advanced management features.
- **Features**: Support remote monitoring, environmental sensors, and integration with data center infrastructure management (DCIM) software.
- **Benefits**: Provide comprehensive power management and monitoring for critical environments.

## Installation Guidelines
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute the power load evenly across all PDUs to avoid overloading circuits.
- **Redundancy**: Implement redundant PDUs for critical equipment to ensure continuous power availability.
- **Cable Management**: Organize power cables to minimize clutter and improve airflow.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Use PDUs with built-in environmental sensors to monitor temperature and humidity.

## Compliance and Standards
- **UL Listing**: Ensure all PDUs are UL-listed for safety and reliability.
- **ANSI/TIA-942**: Follow guidelines for power distribution in data centers.
- **NEC**: Comply with the National Electrical Code for all electrical installations.
