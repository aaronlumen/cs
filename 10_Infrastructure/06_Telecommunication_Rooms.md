# Telecommunications Rooms (TR)

## General Requirements
Telecommunications rooms (TR) house telecommunications equipment, cable terminations, and cross-connects. Proper design and maintenance of TRs are crucial for the reliability and performance of the network.

## Location and Layout
- **Accessibility**: TRs should be centrally located to minimize cable lengths and ensure easy access for maintenance.
- **Space**: Provide adequate space for current equipment and future expansion.
- **Environmental Control**: Maintain appropriate temperature and humidity levels to protect equipment.

## Equipment Racks and Cabinets
- **Standard**: Use 19-inch racks and cabinets.
- **Installation**: Secure racks and cabinets to the floor and/or walls.
- **Spacing**: Ensure adequate spacing between racks and cabinets for airflow and cable management.

## Cable Management
- **Vertical and Horizontal Managers**: Use vertical and horizontal cable managers to organize cables.
- **Pathways**: Use conduits, trays, or ducts to route cables within the TR.
- **Labeling**: Clearly label all cables, racks, and equipment for easy identification.

## Power and Grounding
- **Power Distribution**: Provide sufficient power outlets and circuits for all equipment.
- **UPS**: Use uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to protect critical equipment from power interruptions.
- **Grounding**: Follow TIA-607 standards for grounding and bonding all equipment and racks.

## Security
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to authorized personnel only.
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring systems to detect and alert on unauthorized access or environmental changes.

## Maintenance and Inspection
- **Regular Inspections**: Conduct regular inspections to ensure the integrity and performance of the TR.
- **Cleaning**: Keep TRs clean and free of dust and debris.
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of all equipment, cabling, and configurations.
## Telco Closet / MDF \- IDF  LV Standards

CommonSpirit Health Telecom Closets

##### *(MPOE or MDF)* 

Main Point of Entry or Main Distribution Frame 

1\. This location shall be designed/sized to serve the entire building based on the assessment results. This closet is to be centrally located so as to ensure that all copper voice and data cable sheath lengths out to the outlets are less than 90 m (295 ft). This closet shall interconnect with each Telecommunications Closet (TC) Telecommunications Closet or Intermediate Distribution Facility (IDF) via distinct, dedicated single-mode fiber optic backbone cables, 25 pair twisted pair CAT 6 data risers and 25 pair twisted pair voice riser cables. In smaller buildings, where only one telecommunications closet is required, the MDF will also function as the IDF.

##### *(TC or IDF) \-* 

2\.  This location shall be designed/sized to serve the floor on which it is located, and the floors above and below, based on the assessment results. This closet is to be centrally located so as to ensure that all copper voice and data cable sheath lengths out to the outlets are less than 90 m (295 ft). 

In larger buildings, several IDFs per floor may be required to adhere to this maximum cable length requirement. The overall design shall minimize the total number of closets while staying within the 90 m (295 ft) requirement. Closets shall be located such that vertical cable installations are limited to three floors either above or below.

##### *Closet Size Requirements*

3\. Closet size requirements are based on distributing telecommunications service to one individual work area per 100 sq. ft. of occupied floor space.  
The total serving area is calculated using only the worker-occupied floor space.

##### *Minimum Telco closet sizes*

4\. Minimum telecommunications closet (MDF or IDF) sizes are shown in the table  
Below:

IF THE SERVING AREA IS THEN THE CLOSET MUST BE AT LEAST  
Less than 5,000 sq. ft. 8 ft x 10 ft. Negotiated with Information Technology Services  
Between 5,000 sq. ft. and 8,000 sq. ft 10 ft. x 10 ft.  
Larger than 8,000 sq. ft. 10 ft. x 12 ft.

##### *No shared space or utility access*

5\. No other utilities shall pass through the MDF, IDF or TC, except for building  
sprinkler systems. This room shall not be shared with or used for any function  
other than legitimate data network and telecommunication systems. Each room shall be designed and located to minimize the potential for water entry.

##### *Floor distances MDF/IDF*

6\. Ideally, each floor of the building should have at most one centrally located MDF or IDF closet. Where distance permits, closets on certain floors may be omitted. Closets shall be vertically stacked. Closets shall be connected by four \- 4" EMT sleeves conduits or equivalent cable tray, without offsets, for a clear cable pull.

7\. The design and construction of all new Node (Switch) rooms shall be coordinated with the stakeholders which may include IT PM, department staff etc.

##### *Required: Power Audit by hired consultant / Project manager* 

8\. Power audit shall be completed by consultant with the assistance of CommonSpirit Project Managers. The audit shall determine the need, if any, for additional power conditioning equipment. Each closet shall have a dedicated power panel with integral Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor (TVSS) provided. Power panel shall be 18 pole minimum. Where available power panel shall be connected to the emergency power system in the building. If not available system shall be designed to allow future installation of emergency power.

##### *MDF/IDF template standardized design*

9\. Standard layout of the MDF, IDF, or TC shall be similar to Detail (see attached image) D-9-A, “Typical ISU MDF/IDF Closet Layout”.

##### *Building design plans including closet and raceway locations* 

10\. A complete building design including closet and raceway locations and closet layouts shall be submitted for review to the LV SA’s as a standard for commonspirit enterprise LV Architecture  in advance of the issuance of permission to proceed with the project.

##### *Door Requirements*

11\. The MDF or IDF shall not have door sills or center posts. The door shall be 7 feet high by 3 feet. wide, lockable, and open outward. Doors and frames shall be designed and piped for door alarms or future electric locksets and access control system readers.
