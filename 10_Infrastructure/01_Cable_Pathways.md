# Cable Pathways

## General Requirements
Cable pathways provide the physical routes for telecommunications cabling. Proper planning and installation of cable pathways are essential to ensure a reliable and efficient network.

## Types of Pathways
### Conduits
- **Material**: Use rigid or flexible metal conduits.
- **Size**: Ensure conduits are adequately sized to accommodate current and future cabling needs, with at least 25% spare capacity.
- **Installation**: Run conduits in straight lines with minimal bends. Use sweep bends instead of 90-degree elbows where possible.

### Cable Trays
- **Types**: Use ladder, trough, or basket-type trays.
- **Support**: Secure trays to the building structure at intervals not exceeding 5 feet.
- **Capacity**: Ensure cable trays are sized to provide at least 25% spare capacity.

### J-Hooks
- **Usage**: Use J-hooks for shorter cable runs or where trays and conduits are impractical.
- **Spacing**: Space J-hooks at intervals not exceeding 4 feet.
- **Capacity**: Size J-hooks to provide adequate support without overloading.

## Installation Guidelines
- **Separation from Power**: Maintain a minimum separation of 12 inches from power cables to prevent interference.
- **Support**: Ensure all pathways provide adequate support to prevent sagging or stress on cables.
- **Fire-Rated Pathways**: Use fire-rated pathways in plenum spaces and where required by code.

## Future-Proofing
- **Expansion**: Design pathways with future expansion in mind. Allow for additional cables without significant modifications.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure pathways are accessible for maintenance and upgrades.
