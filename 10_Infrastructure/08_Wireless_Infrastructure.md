# Wireless Infrastructure

## General Requirements
Wireless infrastructure is essential for providing seamless connectivity in healthcare facilities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of wireless networks ensure reliable and secure access.

## Wireless Access Points (WAPs)
- **Placement**: Strategically place WAPs to provide optimal coverage and minimize interference.
- **Types**: Use enterprise-grade WAPs that support the latest Wi-Fi standards (e.g., Wi-Fi 6).
- **Power**: Use Power over Ethernet (PoE) to simplify installation and power management.

## Wireless Controllers
- **Centralized Management**: Use wireless controllers to manage and configure WAPs.
- **Features**: Ensure controllers support features such as load balancing, roaming, and security.

## Security
- **Encryption**: Use WPA3 encryption to secure wireless communications.
- **Authentication**: Implement robust authentication mechanisms, such as 802.1X, to control access to the wireless network.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor wireless network activity to detect and respond to threats.

## Performance Optimization
- **Channel Planning**: Use non-overlapping channels and adjust power levels to minimize interference.
- **Bandwidth Management**: Implement quality of service (QoS) policies to prioritize critical applications.
- **Regular Assessments**: Conduct regular site surveys and performance assessments to optimize coverage and capacity.

## Maintenance and Updates
- **Firmware Updates**: Regularly update the firmware of WAPs and controllers to ensure security and performance.
- **Inspections**: Conduct periodic inspections to ensure WAPs are functioning correctly and are free of physical damage.
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of the wireless network design, configurations, and changes.
