# Horizontal Cabling

## General Requirements
Horizontal cabling connects telecommunications outlets in work areas to the horizontal cross-connect in telecommunications rooms.

## Cable Types
### Category 6A Cables
- **Usage**: Standard for high-speed data transmission in healthcare environments.
- **Performance**: Ensure cables meet or exceed TIA-568-C.2 standards.

## Installation Guidelines
- **Pathways**: Use conduits, trays, or J-hooks to support horizontal cabling.
- **Separation**: Maintain a minimum separation of 12 inches from power cables to prevent interference.
- **Support**: Secure cables at regular intervals to prevent sagging and damage.

## Termination and Testing
- **Termination**: Use high-quality connectors and proper termination techniques.
- **Testing**: Perform and document tests for continuity, length, attenuation, and return loss.

## Labeling and Documentation
- **Labeling**: Clearly label all horizontal cables at both ends.
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of all horizontal cabling routes, terminations, and test results.
