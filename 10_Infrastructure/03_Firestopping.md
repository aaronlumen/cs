## Importance of Firestopping
Firestopping prevents the spread of fire and smoke through penetrations in fire-rated walls and floors, ensuring the safety of building occupants and protecting property.

## Standards and Codes
- Comply with NFPA 70 (National Electrical Code) and NFPA 101 (Life Safety Code).
- Follow local building codes and regulations for firestopping.

## Firestopping Materials
### Sealants
- **Types**: Use intumescent and non-intumescent sealants as required.
- **Applications**: Suitable for cable penetrations, conduit penetrations, and openings around trays and ducts.

### Firestop Collars
- **Usage**: Use around plastic pipes and conduits that penetrate fire-rated walls and floors.
- **Installation**: Secure collars according to manufacturer instructions.

### Firestop Putty and Pads
- **Usage**: Ideal for sealing small openings and gaps around cables and conduits.
- **Installation**: Mold putty to fit the shape of the penetration and press firmly into place.

## Installation Guidelines
- **Preparation**: Clean surfaces to remove dust, debris, and grease before applying firestopping materials.
- **Application**: Apply firestopping materials according to manufacturer instructions. Ensure complete coverage of the penetration.
- **Inspection**: Inspect firestopping installations to ensure compliance with codes and manufacturer guidelines.

## Maintenance and Inspection
- **Regular Inspections**: Conduct regular inspections of firestopping installations to ensure integrity and compliance.
- **Repairs**: Repair any damaged or compromised firestopping materials promptly.
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of all firestopping installations, inspections, and repairs.
