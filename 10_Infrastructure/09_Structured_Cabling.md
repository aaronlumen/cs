# Structured Cabling

## General Requirements
The structured cabling system is critical for the successful deployment of technology throughout the facility. This document outlines the requirements for backbone and horizontal cabling.

## Backbone Cabling for IT Network
- All new and existing TDR locations must have dedicated 24-strand single-mode fiber to the TEC location.
- Use high strand count fiber to minimize pathway fill, ensuring dedicated fusion splice connections for each TDR location.

## Horizontal Cabling for IT Network
- Deploy Category 6 cabling to all outlets from new TDR locations.
- Replace lower grade cabling in existing TDR locations with Category 6 cabling.

## Cabling and Connection Analysis for Multi-Floor Division
- Conduct analysis to remediate connections between floors from adjacent TDRs.
- Define network electronics requirements based on active port count and device connections on each floor.

## Wireless for Voice and Location-Based Services
- Install Category 6A cabling to each wireless access point location.
- Label wireless access points according to CommonSpirit Health standards.

## Backbone and Horizontal Cabling for Non-CommonSpirit Health IT Systems
- Ensure separate routing and cabling for vendor systems and CommonSpirit Health IT Network.
- Physically separate telemetry and CATV systems in TDR locations.

## Labeling Standards
- Label faceplates using the format IDF.room.number_rack.number_patch.panel.number_port.number for easy identification and management.
