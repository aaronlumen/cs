# Backbone Cabling

## General Requirements
Backbone cabling provides the primary data pathways between telecommunications rooms, equipment rooms, and entrance facilities.

## Cable Types
### Fiber Optic Cables
- **Single-mode**: Use for long-distance and high-bandwidth applications.
- **Multimode**: Use for shorter distances and lower bandwidth applications.

### Copper Cables
- **Category 6A or higher**: Use for high-speed data transmission over shorter distances.

## Installation Guidelines
- **Pathways**: Use conduits, trays, or ducts to protect and support backbone cabling.
- **Separation**: Maintain adequate separation from power cables to prevent interference.
- **Support**: Secure cables at regular intervals to prevent sagging and damage.

## Termination and Testing
- **Termination**: Use high-quality connectors and proper termination techniques.
- **Testing**: Perform and document tests for continuity, length, attenuation, and return loss.

## Labeling and Documentation
- **Labeling**: Clearly label all backbone cables at both ends.
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of all backbone cabling routes, terminations, and test results.
