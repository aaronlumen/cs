# Faceplate Labeling

## General Requirements
Proper labeling of faceplates is essential for the management and maintenance of the telecommunications infrastructure. This document outlines the labeling standards to be followed.

## Labeling Format
- Use the format IDF.room.number_rack.number_patch.panel.number_port.number for all faceplates.
  - **IDF**: Identifier of the Intermediate Distribution Frame.
  - **Room Number**: The room number where the faceplate is located.
  - **Rack Number**: The rack number in the IDF.
  - **Patch Panel Number**: The number of the patch panel in the rack.
  - **Port Number**: The port number on the patch panel.

## Labeling Examples
- Example 1: IDF1.101_1.1.1
  - IDF1: First Intermediate Distribution Frame.
  - 101: Room number 101.
  - 1: First rack in the IDF.
  - 1: First patch panel in the rack.
  - 1: First port on the patch panel.
- Example 2: IDF2.202_2.2.10
  - IDF2: Second Intermediate Distribution Frame.
  - 202: Room number 202.
  - 2: Second rack in the IDF.
  - 2: Second patch panel in the rack.
  - 10: Tenth port on the patch panel.

## Label Placement
- Labels should be placed on the faceplate in a clear and visible manner.
- Ensure labels are durable and resistant to wear and tear.

## Documentation
- Maintain a spreadsheet with the following information for each faceplate:
  - Faceplate Identifier
  - Room Number
  - Rack Number
  - Patch Panel Number
  - Port Number
  - Device Connected
  - Cable ID
- Provide the spreadsheet to CommonSpirit Health-PDC IT Manager.

## Compliance
- Ensure all labeling adheres to CommonSpirit Health standards and guidelines.
- Regularly audit and update labels as needed to maintain accuracy and compliance.
